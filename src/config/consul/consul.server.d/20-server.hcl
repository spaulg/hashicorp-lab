# server
# This flag is used to control if an agent is in server or client mode. When provided,
# an agent will act as a Consul server. Each Consul cluster must have at least one
# server and ideally no more than 5 per datacenter. All servers participate in the Raft
# consensus algorithm to ensure that transactions occur in a consistent, linearizable
# manner. Transactions modify cluster state, which is maintained on all server nodes to
# ensure availability in the case of node failure. Server nodes also participate in a
# WAN gossip pool with server nodes in other datacenters. Servers act as gateways to
# other datacenters and forward traffic as appropriate.
server = true

# bootstrap-expect
# This flag provides the number of expected servers in the datacenter. Either this value
# should not be provided or the value must agree with other servers in the cluster. When
# provided, Consul waits until the specified number of servers are available and then
# bootstraps the cluster. This allows an initial leader to be elected automatically. This
# cannot be used in conjunction with the legacy -bootstrap flag. This flag requires
# -server mode.
bootstrap_expect = 1
